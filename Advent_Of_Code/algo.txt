Algorithm:
1. Find the largest blocks + the bank # associated
with the number of blocks
2. Set that bank value to 0, while store the 
# of blocks in a variable
3. Re-index the banks' order(set x bank to the last
element and x+1 the first element) for block
distribution
4. Redistribute the blocks
5.
